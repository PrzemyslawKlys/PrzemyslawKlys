### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Przemek, I'm IT Architect with over 15 years of experience in IT. I'm mostly focused on PowerShell, but I do work with C#, JavaScript, Css and HTML. I try to use the best tool for the job rather then trying to focus on particular language. Just because that tool is always PowerShell it doesn't mean I am PowerShell biased ðŸ˜‚

I've decided that all projects that I own or maintain are created as part of [Evotec IT](https://github.com/EvotecIT) organization, while I keep my profile for forks of projects I contribute to. This is why you won't see much action on my profile, because most of it goes into **Evotec IT** organization that I own.
