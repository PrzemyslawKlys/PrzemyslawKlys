I'm IT Architect with over 15 years of experience in IT. I'm [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003657?fullName=Przemys%C5%82aw%20K%C5%82ys) since 2020. I'm mostly focused on PowerShell, but I do work with C#, JavaScript, Css and HTML. I try to use the best tool for the job rather then trying to focus on particular language. Just because that tool is always PowerShell it doesn't mean I am PowerShell biased 😂

I've decided that all projects that I own or maintain are created as part of [Evotec IT](https://github.com/EvotecIT) organization, while I keep my profile for forks of projects I contribute to. This is why you won't see much action on my profile, because most of it goes into **Evotec IT** organization that I own.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [PSWriteHTML](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWriteHTML), [Testimo](https://github.com/EvotecIT/Testimo), [GPOZaurr](https://github.com/EvotecIT/GPOZaurr), [PSWinDocumentation](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWinDocumentation), and few other projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **HTML** & **JavaScript** & **CSS**
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any of the projects in [Evotec IT](https://github.com/EvotecIT) organization

While the number of stars on a single project is merely <!-- GITHUB-ORGANIZATION-TopProjectStars:START -->646<!-- GITHUB-ORGANIZATION-TopProjectStars:END -->, there are currently <!-- GITHUB-ORGANIZATION-TotalStars:START -->4826<!-- GITHUB-ORGANIZATION-TotalStars:END --> stars for all of my projects.
